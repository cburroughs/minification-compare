Minification Compare
==========

### Hey, what's this?

A minifier transforms something (javascript or CSS) and transforms it
into an into an equivalent form that takes up fewer bytes.  Unlike a
compression algorithm, it is not necessary to reverse the
transformation before use.  The simplest minification is removing
white space.  Under the hood a minification program might be anything
from a scrappy gang of regular expression to a source to source
compiler.  Right now this is a program for comparing two minification
programs.  There are already sites that will perform an n-way
comparison with pretty tables.  The original use case here was helping with
developing minifiers.

No attempt is made to determine if the transformations are correct.
Thus the more difficult but infinitely more important question of
correctness is not answered by this program.


### Use

Type --help.  There are some python package
dependencies.  The number of them may be reduced in the future.  I
have only tested with python2.6 so far.

### Interpreting results

There are two comparisons of interest to most people.: bytes -->
minified bytes, and gzip (zlib) -6 bytes --> minified gzip (zlib) -6
bytes. For HTTP content delivery, it is the gzipped size comparison
that matters unless you users primarily use some *very* old user
agents.  If you have a use for magnifiers other than HTTP content
delivery you should tell me about it because that sounds interesting.

Note again that smaller is not always better.  Correctness (which
unfortunately may include preserving wacky comments that cause IE6 to
behave differently) is more important, and may result in larger files.
